The concept of ownership is the unique feature of Rust that guarentees memory safety without needing a garbage collector. 

### Stack vs Heap
Pushing to stack is fast and efficient, all data stored on the stack must have a fixed size that can be known at compile time. Heap is used for dynamically allocated values with an unknown size at compile time (e.g. `String`). 

### Ownership
The concept of ownership addresses:
- keeping track of what code is using what data on the heap
- minimizing duplicate data on the heap
- cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don't run out of memory.      

In other words, the main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data.

### Ownership rules
1. Each value in Rust has an owner
2. There can only be one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped. 

### Variable scope
```
    {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward
        // do stuff with s
    }   // s is no longer valid here
```

### `&str` and `String`
`&str` is a fixed size text (immutable), so it can be bundled with the executable binary file at compile time. However, `String` is dynamically allocated (mutable) so it is stored in the heap. 

### Allocation and `drop` 
```
    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }   // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid, drop() is called
```
In some languages, unused variables are cleaned up by GC (Garbage Collector). Rust takes a different approach with `ownership`, once the variable that owns a chunk of memory on the heap goes out of scope, its memory is returned. Rust uses a special function called `drop` which is called automatically at the closing curly brackets. 

### Move
For fixed sized values (`i32`, `f64`), Rust performs `copy` of the value:
```
let a = 25;
let b = a;   // the value of a is copied.
```
But with `String`s, Rust performs `copy` of the pointer on the stack (also called `shallow copy`):
```
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = s1;
```
This operation is called `move` because Rust moves `s1` to `s2` and invalidates `s1`. So this doesn't compile:
```
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = s1; // s2 is the owner now
println!("{s1}"); // THIS DOESN'T WORK: value borrowed here after move!!!
```
Rust considers `s1` as invalid after move, so it only drops `s2` after `s2` goes out of scope.

### Deep copy
This copies the heap data instead of the pointer on the stack (also called `deep copy`)
```
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```
Rust performs `deep copy` on these fixed sized types:
- All integers types such as `u64`
- All floating numbers: such as `f32`
- Boolean type: `bool`
- The character type: `char`
- Tuples with fixed-sized values such as `(i32, i32)`

These `copy` types implements a Rust trait called `Copy`.

### Ownership and Functions
When a dynamically-sized type is passed to a function as a parameter, the ownership also moves to the function:
```
fn takes_ownership(s: String){  // new owner of s
    println!("{s}"); // do some stuff with s
} // s is dropped

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Hello!");
    takes_ownership(s);
    println!("{s}"); // THIS DOESN'T WORK: value borrowed here after move!!!
}
```
However, Rust copies the value for `copy` types, so the value is not moved:
```
fn takes_ownership(s: String){  // new owner of s
    println!("{s}"); // do some stuff with s
} // s is dropped

fn makes_copy(x: i32){  // new variable x
    println!("{x}"); // do stuff with x
}  // x is dropped

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Hello!");
    takes_ownership(s);

    let a = 20;
    takes_copy(a);
    println!("{a}"); // this works
}
```

### Ownership and Return Values
When a variable with data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned by `drop` unless the ownership of its data has been moved to another variable:
```
fn takes_ownership(s: String) -> String {  // new owner of s
    println!("{s}"); // do some stuff
    s // return the value to a new owner
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Hello!");
    let s2 = takes_ownership(s);
    println!("{s2}");
}
```

### References
To avoid giving the ownership to functions, references are used to pass the "view" of values:
```
fn calculate_len(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference
    s.len() 
} // here s goes out of scope, it is dropped, but the value it points to is not dropped.

fn main() {
    let hello = String::from("Hello");
    let length = calculate_len(&hello);
    println!("{s}"); // This works, we didn't give the ownership of the value, instead passed a reference
}
```
The action of create a reference is called **borrowing** in Rust. When you borrow something, you don't have the **ownership** of it, you have it give it back.

### Mutable References
There can only be one mutable reference to a value in Rust:
```
fn change(s: &mut String){
    s.push_str("World!");
}

fn main() {
    let mut hello = String::from("Hello, ");
    let ref1 = &mut hello;
    let ref2 = &mut hello;
    println!("{ref1}, {ref2}"); // THIS DOESN'T WORK: there can only be one "editor" of a value at a time!
}
```
This restriction prevents *data races* where there are multiple mutable references and at least one of them modifies the data and there is no synchronization between all mutations. Therefore, only one mutable reference can point to a value in Rust:
```
fn change(s: &mut String){
    s.push_str("World!");
}

fn main() {
    let mut hello = String::from("Hello, ");
    let ref1 = &mut hello;
    change(ref1);
    println!("{ref1}"); // This works.
}
```

Rust also prevents having immutable and mutable references at the same time:
```
fn main() {
    let mut hello = String::from("Hello");
    let ref1 = &hello;
    let ref2 = &mut hello;
    println!("{ref1}, {ref2}"); // THIS DOESN'T WORK: cannot borrow `hello` as mutable 
                                // because it is also borrowed as immutable
}
```
Users of the immutable references don't expect the value suddenly change!

### Dangling
Rust compiler prevents creating a *dangling* references: a reference which loosely hang on pointing to a value that's been lost ownership or freed up. 
```
fn dangling() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s is a new String
    &s // we return a reference to s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!

fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangling(); // THIS DOESN'T WORK: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, 
                                           // but there is no value for it to be borrowed from
    println!("{reference_to_nothing}");
}
```
The solution is to just return the `String`:
```
fn dont_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("Hello");
    s
}

fn main() {
    let s = dont_dangle();
    println!("{s}");
}
```

### The Slice Type
A string slice is a reference to part of a `String`:
```
let s = String::from("hello world");
let hello = &s[0..5]; // doesn't include 5th character
let world = &s[6..11];
```
If the end of range is the last element of the string, drop the end range:
```
let world = &s[6..];
```
Find the first word in `String`:
```
fn find_first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }
    
    &s[..]
}

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = find_first_word(&s);
    println!("{word}");
}
```
A string literal is already a slice type, so this function signature can work for both `&str` and `String`s:
```
fn find_first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }
    
    &s[..]
}

fn main() {
    // addition
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = find_first_word(&s);
    println!("{word}");

    let s = "hello world";
    let word = find_first_word(s);
    println!("{word}");
}
```

### Array Slice
The same slicing can be applied to arrays:
```
let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
let slice = &a[1..3]; // [2,3]
```
