Rust allows this *module system* to organize Rust projects:
- **Package**s - a Cargo feature that build, test and share crates. 
- **Crate**s - a tree of modules that produces a library or executable
- **Module**s and `use` - to control the organization, scope and privacy of paths
- **Path**s - a way of naming an item such as `struct`, function or module.
